# These values are used by docker-compose.yml to set up the 'db' service
# and are passed to the 'backend' service.
#
# IMPORTANT: For local development with Docker Compose, you can copy this file
# to a new file named '.env' in the project root:
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# Then, you can customize the values in '.env' if needed.
# The docker-compose.yml file is configured to use these environment variables
# with defaults if they are not set in the .env file.
